/**
 * <tt>RyCON</tt> is the entry point of the program.
 * <p>
 * This class is used to show the name 'RyCON' for Mac OS X users, because of there is
 * no Info.plist file used at the moment. This will be changed in a future version of RyCON.
 * <p>
 * For more information see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/00-Intro/JavaDevelopment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001911-SW1">Apple documentation about java</a> on the web.
 * <p>
 * Because of the fact that there are a lot of users who has java version 7 running,
 * <tt>RyCON</tt> doesn't use any functions of java version 8. However, <tt>RyCON</tt> runs under java version 7 or higher.
