tipConverterWidget=With RyCON it is possible to convert coordinates and measurement files between different formats.\n\n\
\
RyCON supports different formats and can be supplemented later on with additional formats.\n\n\
\
RyCON does not overwrite original files. Instead of this, the files are stored in an output file. It is named by 'filename_CONV.ENDING'.
tipGeneratorWidget=RyCON creates new folders including substructure from templates after entering the project number, several folders are created at the same time if the names are separated by a comma, existing folders cannot be changed or deleted. \n\n\
\
Defaults for paths and template folders can be defined in the settings of RyCON.
tipLevellingWidget=With RyCON it is possible to prepare levelling files in LEICA GSI format (point number + height ) or NIGRA height files for cad import.\n\n\
\
The program fills in pseudo measurement values for x- and y-coordinates. Each value will be raised by one meter each string.\n\n\
\
RyCON does not overwrite original files. Instead of this, the files are stored in an output file.
tipSplitterWidget=With RyCON it is possible to split measurement files by code in LEICA GSI or text format automatically.\n\n\
\
The program detects measurement lines with code and put them into one output file for each code. This file only contains lines of one code.\n\n\
\
RyCON does not overwrite original files. Instead of this, the files are stored in an output file. It is named by 'filename_CODE_X.ending'.
tipTidyUpWidget=With RyCON it is possible to clean up measurement files in LEICA GSI format and Leica Geosystems logfile.txt format automatically.\n\n\
\
The program detects known points, free stations and target points and do not put them into the output file. Additionally it is possible to remove the orientation control measurements.\n\n\
\
RyCON does not overwrite original files. Instead of this, the files are stored in an output file. It is named by default to 'filename_EDIT.GSI'. This setting can be changed in the preferences.
