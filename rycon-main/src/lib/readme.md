# General

Some external libraries have different licences which are not the same which are used for **RyCON**.

## swisstopo REFRAME.jar

The REFRAME library allows all transformations in position and height that are relevant in Switzerland and available in the software REFRAME for GeoSuite (except UTM projection):
+ GPSREF (ETRF93 <-> LV95)
+ FINELTRA (LV95 <-> LV03)
+ CHGEO2004 (geoid model)
+ HTRANS (LHN95 <-> LN02)

You will find the latest version on the website of [swisstopo](https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/products/geo_software/DLL_info). Just put it into this folder.
